#How the anagram finder works

after cloning this repo, make sure to run `npm install` to get all dependencies

to run backend, you need to be in the /backend folder, then run
`PORT=3001 npm start`

to run client, you need to be in the /client folder, then run
`npm start`

the client will not work without the backend.

The entire application is written with JavaScript/ES6. The backend makes use of Node's Express library, while the client uses React.
